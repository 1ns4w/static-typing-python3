## 4. Run mypy

Look for errors in the examples without running them:
```
mypy ./samples/first_example.py
```

```
mypy ./samples/second_example.py
```

**Note: this is the fourth step of this demonstration, so I highly suggest reading the [instructions](https://github.com/ins4w/static-typing-python3/blob/main/README.md) before.**
